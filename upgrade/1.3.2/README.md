# CSM 1.3.2 Patch Installation Instructions

## Introduction

This document guides an administrator through the patch update to Cray Systems Management (CSM) `v1.3.2` from `v1.3.1`.
If upgrading from CSM `v1.2.2` directly to `v1.3.2`, follow the procedures described in [Upgrade CSM](../README.md) instead.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Fixed a scale issue with the `/v1/hardware` API in the System Layout Service (SLS) causing the service to become deadlocked.
* Updated the `hms-hmcollector` to be accessible at the hostname `hmcollector.hmnlb.$SYSTEM_NAME.$SITE_DOMAIN`, in addition to its IP address `10.94.100.71`.

## Steps

1. [Preparation](#preparation)
1. [Update `customizations.yaml`](#update-customizationsyaml)
1. [Setup Nexus](#setup-nexus)
1. [Upgrade services](#upgrade-services)
1. [Verification](#verification)
1. [Complete upgrade](#complete-upgrade)

## Preparation

1. Start a typescript on `ncn-m001` to capture the commands and output from this procedure.

   ```bash
   script -af csm-update.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt
   export PS1='\u@\H \D{%Y-%m-%d} \t \w # '
   ```

1. Download and extract the CSM `v1.3.2` release to `ncn-m001`.

   See [Download and Extract CSM Product Release](../../update_product_stream/index.md#download-and-extract).

1. Set `CSM_DISTDIR` to the directory of the extracted files.

   **IMPORTANT**: If necessary, change this command to match the actual location of the extracted files.

   ```bash
   CSM_DISTDIR="$(pwd)/csm-1.3.2"
   echo "${CSM_DISTDIR}"
   ```

1. Set `CSM_RELEASE_VERSION` to the CSM release version.

   ```bash
   export CSM_RELEASE_VERSION="$(${CSM_DISTDIR}/lib/version.sh --version)"
   echo "${CSM_RELEASE_VERSION}"
   ```

1. Download and install/upgrade the **latest** documentation on `ncn-m001`.

   See [Check for Latest Documentation](../../update_product_stream/index.md#check-for-latest-documentation).

## Update `customizations.yaml`

1. Retrieve `customizations.yaml` from the `site-init` secret:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secrets -n loftsman site-init -o jsonpath='{.data.customizations\.yaml}' | base64 -d > "customizations.yaml"
   ```

1. Add customizations for the `cray-hms-hmcollector` Helm chart:

   ```bash
   yq w -i "customizations.yaml" 'spec.kubernetes.services.cray-hms-hmcollector.hmcollector_external_hostname' 'hmcollector.hmnlb.{{ network.dns.external }}'
   ```

1. Update the `site-init` secret:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init
   kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml
   ```

1. (Optional) Commit changes to `customizations.yaml`.

   `customizations.yaml` has been updated in this procedure. If using an external Git repository
   for managing customizations as recommended, then clone a local working tree and commit
   appropriate changes to `customizations.yaml`.

   For example:

   ```bash
   git clone <URL> site-init
   cd site-init
   kubectl -n loftsman get secret site-init -o jsonpath='{.data.customizations\.yaml}' | base64 -d - > customizations.yaml
   git add customizations.yaml
   git commit -m 'CSM 1.3 upgrade - customizations.yaml'
   git push
   ```

## Setup Nexus

Run `lib/setup-nexus.sh` to configure Nexus and upload new CSM RPM
repositories, container images, and Helm charts:

```bash
cd "$CSM_DISTDIR"
./lib/setup-nexus.sh
```

On success, `setup-nexus.sh` will output `OK` on `stderr` and exit with status
code `0`. For example:

```console
./lib/setup-nexus.sh

[... output omitted ...]

+ Nexus setup complete
setup-nexus.sh: OK
echo $?
0
```

In the event of an error, consult [Troubleshoot Nexus](../../operations/package_repository_management/Troubleshoot_Nexus.md)
to resolve potential problems and then try running `setup-nexus.sh` again. Note that subsequent runs of `setup-nexus.sh` may
report `FAIL` when uploading duplicate assets. This is okay as long as `setup-nexus.sh` outputs `setup-nexus.sh: OK` and exits
with status code `0`.

## Upgrade services

Run `upgrade.sh` to deploy upgraded CSM applications and services:

```bash
cd "$CSM_DISTDIR"
./upgrade.sh
```

## Update test suite packages

Update the `csm-testing` and `goss-servers` RPMs on the NCNs, adjusting the `pdsh` node ranges for the node type and counts on your system.

```bash
pdsh -f 1 -w ncn-m00[1-3],ncn-w00[1-3],ncn-s00[1-3] "zypper install -y csm-testing goss-servers"
```

## Verification

1. Verify that the new CSM version is in the product catalog.

   Verify that the new CSM version is listed in the output of the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o jsonpath='{.data.csm}' | yq r -j - | jq -r 'to_entries[] | .key' | sort -V
   ```

   Example output that includes the new CSM version (`1.3.2`):

   ```text
   0.9.2
   0.9.3
   0.9.4
   0.9.5
   0.9.6
   1.0.1
   1.0.10
   1.2.0
   1.2.1
   1.2.2
   1.3.0
   1.3.1
   1.3.2
   ```

1. Confirm that the product catalog has an accurate timestamp for the CSM upgrade.

   Confirm that the `import_date` reflects the timestamp of the upgrade.

   ```bash
   kubectl get cm cray-product-catalog -n services -o jsonpath='{.data.csm}' | yq r  - '"1.3.2".configuration.import_date'
   ```

## Complete upgrade

1. Remember to exit the typescript that was started at the beginning of the upgrade.

     ```bash
     exit
     ```

It is recommended to save the typescript file for later reference.
